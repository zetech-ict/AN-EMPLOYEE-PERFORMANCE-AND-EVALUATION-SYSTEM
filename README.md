## Problem Statement

Ideally when customers have been served by the employees, they should be able to give a brief feedback to show wether they were sastified  by the services offered by the employees. This will informatiomn will be able to be accessed by the admin as he/she evaluates the perfomance of the employees.Currently not all customers are given the privilege and platfom to give feedback on how they were served by the employees in an organisation.One of the impacts to the institution/organization if the customer feedback is not implemented is that  customers may decide to shift to other institution for better services offered to them.The potential solution is to create a platform for customers to access and give feedback.If claim is being made, solution will be offered for better services to the customers.
